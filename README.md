# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/) Futbol project.

A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.
- Our plan is to check in every time we are working live together, and then check in daily over slack over anything that has been delegated to individual team members, to see if team members need help, etc.  

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.
- We are using Notion to separate the project into each iteration, and outlining tasks that need to be completed (as a group or individually) in each folder. As we meet each day, we will go through to do lists, and mark off what has been done by it's due date.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.
- We discussed using Trello or GitHub Projects and after doing some research into each, we decided to go with Notion, to a separate project management tool that was recommended. We discussed using first day to complete iteration 1 in depth, and assuming we would need a few days for iteration 2 given it required coding and testing. Then predicitng that it would only take one other full day to complete iteraiton 3.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.
- Based on reading over iteration 2, we have designated needing 3 classes on top of our StartTracker class. Game Statistics, League Statistics, and Season Statistics and building their respective methods within each class. We also have already created our runner.rb file and spec_helper.fil. We decided to create dummy .txt files for our CSV methods and going from there in terms of accessing the correct data for our methods.
